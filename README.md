Points to be noted:
1. Docker image which will be used is hosted on docker hub with name **annoying21/els:v1**
2. to construct the config map command is given in **config-map-file.txt**
3. Persistent volume is present in **persistent-volume/els.yml**
4. Statefulset is present in **stateful-set/els.yml**

## Doubts
1. I have'nt created service.
2. I also not added container in stateful set.
